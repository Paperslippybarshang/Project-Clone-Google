# Project: Cloning Google Home Page

---

This is a copy of Google's home page.<br/>
The purpose of this project is to apply basic HTML and CSS concepts that I learned from Springboard. I've tried to apply semantic HTML, such as `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. Each of these elements were positioned using CSS Flexbox. <br/>

*\*The links and buttons will not function, *except\* for the "Google Search" button.

## Known Issues

There are still a lot of rooms for improvements and I will continue to update this project to add more details. Here are some of the known issues:<br/>

- [ ] Add responsive design features to the logo, search bar, and the footer.
- [ ] Alignment of "Carbon neutral..." element in the footer is not centered
- [ ] Adjust the alignment of top left navigation links
